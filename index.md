### Projects
**Developed a techno-economic study on storage management based on Markov decision process**
- Proposed a multi-stage management problem of a price-maker welfare-maximizing energy storage in a pool-based electricity
market under stochastic renewable environment.
- Developed a threshold structure of the optimal policy which helps to determine the optimal charging and discharging rates under
dynamic pricing conditions.

- Proposed the trading mechanism based on blockchain for privacy protecting and multi-party coordination.
- Created a modified distributed algorithm to accelerate the solution process.
- First authored a conference paper awarded as the [best conference paper](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xxxw/115204.jhtml)

**Developed an integrated pricing method for integrated energy market**
- Collaborated in two projects on the optimization and control of multi-energy system management.
- Proposed a pricing method, referred to as generalized locational marginal pricing, to reduce price cross-subsidies between different energy systems and guide customers for smart energy use.
- Published two papers as the first author, including 1 SCI-indexed journal paper, 1 EI-indexed journal paper.
